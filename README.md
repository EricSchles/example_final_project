# Example final project

The goal of this project is to provide a reasonably complete example of what a "solution".  Looks like.  This necessarily 'this' solution is out of bounds.  That said, hopefully it will be a helpful tool for others as they consider various forms of analysis and ways to structure it to be successful.  This may also be a good way to structure take home projects for job interviews at companies ;)

## The Data

For this example I have elected to make use of the "green" taxi dataset, which can be found here: https://www1.nyc.gov/site/tlc/about/tlc-trip-record-data.page

This dataset is specifically the january 2014 data.

You can find the accompanying data dictionary here: https://www1.nyc.gov/assets/tlc/downloads/pdf/data_dictionary_trip_records_green.pdf

## Goals of this analysis

Any analysis should be broken down into the following steps:

1. data cleaning
2. exploratory analysis
3. coming up with a list of questions
4. modeling
5. write up and question answering

## This is the proof of concept phase

Any truly good data science effort starts with a proof of concept.  This is where a bet is made.  Once we are "reasonably" sure that the bet will pay off we go to production.  And the whole process likely starts all over again, but in a different context and with different concerns.

I will be making a "productionization" version of this solution in an adjoining repository for later use.
